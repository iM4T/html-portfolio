<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi !<br />
My name is Matt and I'm a 29 years old Sound Engineer that is trying to learn code to consolidate my computer knowledge.<br />
I've started to learn python a year and a half ago, and created some Mac apps to automate some redundant tasks I have with my job.
</p>

<p>I mainly use Udemy as a learning platform<br />
I'm currently following these lessons :
  <ul>
    <li>Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu</li>
    <li>Python : La formation compl√®te by Thibault Houdon</li>
    <li>The Git and GitHub Bootcamp by Colt Steele</li>
  </ul>
</p>
